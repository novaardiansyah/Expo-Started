# Expo Started Kit

Hello Future Developer!

Welcome to my latest creation - the *Expo Starter Kit*! I'm diving into some of the hottest technologies right now, and it's a new and exciting journey for me because I haven't used them before. This time around, I'm exploring what I can build and develop with these technologies, especially for mobile devices like Android and iOS.

Just to give you some background, I'm a web developer at a *Software House* where I primarily work with web development technologies. However, I've always had the desire to create an elegant, dynamic, modern, and easily-developable mobile application using the knowledge I've gained. After some extensive exploration, I stumbled upon a powerful technology called **React Expo**. It exceeded my expectations, allowing me to build mobile applications using just *JavaScript/TypeScript* with minimal adjustments. Surprisingly, I didn't need to delve into *Native* programming languages at all, making it a perfect fit for my needs.

*Thank you for your interest. Happy coding!*
